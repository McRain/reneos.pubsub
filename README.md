##### This package is intended for messaging through a publication (shared bus). Channels have a tree structure and publishing in an inherited channel makes publishing in the parent channel.

```javascript
const EventPub = require("@reneos/pubsub").EventPub
```

### To subscribe to events, use :

```javascript
const key = EventPub.Subscribe("my.path.sub",(data,path)=>{
  console.log(`On Publicate ${data.anyprop} `)
})
```

### A subscription with an empty path will receive all events

### To publish events, use :

```javascript
EventPub.Publish("my.path",{anyprop:'anydata'})
```

### Events will be published all the way, for example:
#### If you published an event along the path "my.path.sub" then the publication will be along the path "my.path.sub" and along the path "my.path" and "my"
